# Production Checklist (v1.11.3)

- HTTPS
  - Required for admin and sessions.
  - Terminate TLS at reverse proxy (nginx/apache).
  - Ensure trusted proxy headers are configured correctly.
- HSTS
  - Recommended: `max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains; preload`.
  - Enable only after confirming HTTPS is stable.
- Environment flags
  - `APP_ENV=prod`
  - `APP_DEBUG=false`
  - `DEVTOOLS_ENABLED=false`
- Storage permissions
  - Writable: `storage/`, `storage/logs/`, `storage/sessions/`, `storage/cache/`, `storage/backups/`.
  - Never expose `storage/` directly via web server.
- Media & Storage
  - Local: keep `storage/uploads` private.
  - S3/MinIO: use private buckets, no public write access.
- Backups
  - Schedule `backup:create` regularly.
  - Periodically run `backup:inspect` and `backup:restore --dry-run`.
- Sessions & Cookies
  - HttpOnly and Secure cookies.
  - SameSite=Lax (or Strict if safe for your flows).
- DevTools
  - Must be disabled in production.
- CSP & Security headers
  - Start with default CSP and tighten over time.
  - When relaxing CSP, document the reason and scope.
- Health checks
  - Use `/health` for readiness/liveness.
  - Health checks are non-destructive by default.
- Read-only mode
  - Use during maintenance windows and restores.
  - Enable before risky migrations or bulk edits.
